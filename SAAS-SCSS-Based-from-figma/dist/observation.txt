**Actual Time Spent**: 11 hours

**Observations and Notes**:

1. **Initial Setup**: Getting the project started, which involved installing necessary npm packages and configuring Gulp, took a bit longer than I thought. There were some complexities with Gulp dependencies, like 'gulp-sass' and 'gulp-terser,' as they needed additional setup, especially because 'gulp-sass' doesn't come with a default compiler anymore, and we had to install the 'sass' package.

2. **Styling**: Converting the provided CSS into SCSS wasn't too difficult, but I noticed that some styles appeared to be missing or there were differences between the SCSS and CSS files provided. To ensure consistency and functionality, I had to make some adjustments, which added to the time.

3. **Media Queries**: Transforming media queries from CSS to SCSS required a substantial amount of time. It was essential to ensure that styles adapted properly to different screen sizes, following the mobile-first approach.

4. **Font Imports**: The original CSS had font-face declarations that needed to be translated into SCSS. The conversion itself was straightforward, but ensuring that the fonts loaded correctly took some testing and tweaking.

5. **JavaScript**: Creating custom JavaScript for the popup modal and making sure it worked well on all types of devices consumed a significant amount of time. Writing JavaScript for the "Learn More" links and handling popups demanded careful thought regarding user interactions.

6. **Testing**: Extensive testing was vital to ensure that the webpage looked good and functioned correctly on different devices and screen sizes, including mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

7. **Image Optimization**: The optimization of images and implementing webp image conversion added extra time. This step was crucial to enhance webpage loading speed.

8. **GitHub Workflow**: Establishing the GitHub repository and adhering to the prescribed workflow took time, including creating feature branches, pull requests, and merging changes.

9. **Overall Styling**: Some aspects of the original design specifications seemed unclear or missing. I had to rely on my judgment to ensure that the webpage appeared well on all devices and adhered to the mobile-first approach.

10. **Finalization**: Ensuring that all files were correctly organized, adding comments for clarity, and preparing the project for submission took additional time.

**Overall**: This task was comprehensive and required a keen eye for detail to ensure that the webpage met the provided design specs and functioned correctly. The actual time exceeded the estimate due to unanticipated challenges
 during project setup and the need to resolve styling and functionality issues.

**Submission**: The code and files have been pushed to the GitHub repository as per the provided instructions. The main branch contains the final code ready for review.
